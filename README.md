# HammerEx
Valve Hammer Editor addon that adds convinience entities for KZ mappers.
Written in a couple of hours as a test, if you're looking for quality code this is not the place, but it works.

## Features

- `trigger_bhop`  Forces a bhop, can bhop on the same block as many times as you want
- `trigger_bhop_single`  Forces a bhop, can only bhop on a block once, jumping on another single bhop resets it
- `trigger_bhop_sequential`  Forces a bhop, can only bhop on a block once, in the correct order
- `trigger_anti_bhop`  Blocks bhopping on a block
- `trigger_anti_crouch`  Blocks crouching
